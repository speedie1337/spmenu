# spmenu themes

spmenu has a profile feature, which allows you to quickly switch between configuration files. For this reason, it is possible to quickly switch between colorschemes.

Feel free to contribute your own colorschemes here.

## Usage

To switch between profiles in spmenu, you use Ctrl+Shift+p. It will spawn a
list of installed profiles, but also allows you to add/remove profiles.

If you want to install a profile, simply copy it to
`~/.config/spmenu/profiles/`. Pressing the keybind will list it. Simply select
it to start using it!

To switch back remove the profile or switch back to the default profile using 'Default'.
