# TODO for spmenu

- Mouse bind array
- Remove SGR sequences from width when item text is drawn, currently the width of the item before SGR sequences are used, resulting in some ugly behavior for the selected item
- Add configuration file using (probably) libconfig
- Fix highlighting for last character in a match
- Add rotate and flip keybinds for the image
