# TODO for spmenu

- Mouse bind array (mouse.h)
- Add configuration file using (probably) libconfig
- Fix arrow drawing (not sure what went wrong yet)
- Use higher level libraries, MD5() is deprecated as of OpenSSL 3 but it has been temporarily silenced. This might also improve compatibility for people who don't use OpenSSL.
- Contextual completions
- Use cairo for text drawing over Xft
