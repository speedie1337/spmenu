# TODO for spmenu

- Mouse bind array (mouse.h)
- Add configuration file using (probably) libconfig, allowing keybinds to be configured without recompiling spmenu
- Use higher level libraries, MD5() is deprecated as of OpenSSL 3 but it has been temporarily silenced. This might also improve compatibility for people who don't use OpenSSL.
- Contextual completions
- Use cairo for text drawing over Xft
- MAYBE wayland support, but only if it doesn't require writing any extra code which as of now seems unlikely
- FIFO, used to dynamically refresh
