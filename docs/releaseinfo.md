### **spmenu 0.1**

### Changelog
- Initial release, see [dmenu](https://codeberg.org/speedie/dmenu) for history.

### Installation
Simply download and unpack the tarball, and `make clean install` as root.

- If you are on Gentoo, you can install `x11-misc/spmenu` by adding my overlay.
- I plan on writing an Arch AUR package eventually, but please feel free to do my job for me!
